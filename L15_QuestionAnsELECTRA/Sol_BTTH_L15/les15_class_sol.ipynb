Electra là một phương pháp học biểu diễn ngôn ngữ (language  representation learning) được ứng dụng cho nhiều bài toán khác nhau, ví dụ như Classification, QA, Text chunking. Đây là một phương pháp học biểu diễn mới, cho phép chúng ta đạt được hiệu năng cao với các Benchmark task trong NLP như SQUAD và GLUE (chi tiết xem tại paper [ ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB)).\n","\n","Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) là một dataset cho bài toán đọc hiểu và trả lời câu hỏi được phát triển bởi đại học Stanford. Trong đó, với mỗi bản ghi, một hệ thống AI sẽ được cung cấp một đoạn văn bản để đọc hiểu và một câu hỏi, nhiệm vụ của hệ thống AI đó là trả lời câu hỏi đó bằng một đoạn trích từ đoạn văn bản được cung cấp nếu có thể, hoặc báo lại là không thể trả lời nếu đoạn văn cung cấp không thể dùng để trả lời câu hỏi.\n","\n","ELECTRA được công bố với ba phiên bản theo kích thước tăng dần như sau: Small, Base, Large. Vì giới hạn về thời gian cũng như khả năng tính toán, trong notebook này ta sẽ tiến hành thử nghiệm với mô hình ELECTRA Small.
